# ⚙️ Python Reusable GitHub Actions Workflow

A flexible and robust reusable workflow to **test and build Python projects** using `pip`, `poetry`, `pipenv`, or `uv`.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

In your GitHub workflow, call this reusable workflow:

```yaml
workflow_call:
  uses: your-org/your-repo/.github/workflows/python-reusable.yml@main
  with:
    python-version: '3.12'
    build-tool: 'poetry'
````

> 📝 Replace `your-org/your-repo` with your actual GitHub organization and repository name.

## 📁 Example Project Structure

```
.
├── pyproject.toml
├── requirements.txt
├── Pipfile
├── tests/
│   ├── test_example.py
│   └── ...
```

✅ Ensure:

* `pytest` is listed in the appropriate dependency file
* Your test files are inside the `tests/` directory

---

## 📦 Dependency Caching

Speeds up installation by caching based on the selected build tool:

| Build Tool | Cache Path          |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| `pip`      | `~/.cache/pip`      |
| `poetry`   | `~/.cache/pypoetry` |
| `pipenv`   | `~/.cache/pipenv`   |
| `uv`       | `~/.cache/uv`       |

---

## 📄 Workflow Summary

A step-by-step summary is printed after each run:

* ✅ Checkout
* 🐍 Python Setup
* 🔎 Input Validation
* 💾 Cache
* 📥 Dependency Install
* 🧪 Test Execution

---

## 🧩 Notes

* Installs the selected build tool automatically if missing
* Fails with a clear message if no dependency file is found
* For `uv`, creates `.venv` if no virtual environment exists

---

## 💡 Ideal For

✅ CI setups across multiple Python projects
✅ Projects using any major Python build tool
✅ Teams aiming for consistent, reusable workflows

---

Enjoy fast and reliable Python CI 🚀
